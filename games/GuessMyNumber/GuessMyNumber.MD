# GuessMyNumber

For my first problem, I decided to go beyond the book and create a prompting game.

Reading from IO is much different, and much harder to understand what's actually happening.

I copied the `prompt` function from [`Prompt.lisp`](../../scripts/Prompt.lisp), which I acquired from **StackOverflow**.

I'm honestly having trouble understanding booleans, why hyphens are used, why capitalization is considered horrible, why `car` and `cdr` are used, why they're being introduced instead of some kind of *nth index list access*, among so many other strange concepts that the book introduced.

Additionally, I'm not sure why the REPL is so emphasized whenever long term programming is done with files, why tiny functions are emphasized with `flet`, and why none of this is explained whenever most people will be coming from a background with `non-lisp`, `C-like` experience, i.e. Java, Python, C++ or Javascript.
